<h2> Description: </h2>
<b> This is a simple program that finds a natural logarithmic binomial, and is useful when evaluating definitive integrals. It's limited to float64 which causes issues if you input or compare to values less than 64 bytes, or 16 decimal points, but gets the job done for now. The program populates arrays for natural log values and decimal values I thought would be sufficient for making computational operations with, and then just searches linearly through basic arithmetic computations until it matches the target input value.
